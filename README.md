# pcss-miniproject-server
Introduction: 

This miniproject is a tcp server - client application game. It aims towards establishing a connection with 3 clients each managing their own interaction with the application. The main program is managed largely by the server and the client relies solely on interacting with the game. Documentation has been provide with this repository along with the a uml and use case diagram in order for other developers to recreate the application. Furthermore an explanation of the rules of the game can be found in the documentation. This game application was thought up by developers involved in this miniproject.

During the process of this project we were left by 2 of the members, so that they could make their own mini project work
THis meant that we had to abondon our initial project to make something simpler. We then decided to focus mostly on the TCP server-client connection, and making a proper optimal connection. 

In order to prove concept, we made a small made up game to show the communication between sever and the different clients. The rules of the game can be found in documentation. 

In terms of github, we met a few errors with the commiting, as one of the members has hundreds of changes because he/she uploaded the first project and others who added to the project has less than half that. 

Ticketing system was a bit misunderstood but was used by the end of the process.
